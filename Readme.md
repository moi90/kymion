# **Kymion** - A Universal Progress Reporting Library

**Kymion** is a Python library designed to help you track and report the progress of tasks, processes, or iterations.
It provides a flexible and extensible system inspired by Python's [logging](https://docs.python.org/3/library/logging.html) module, allowing you to report progress through different handlers.
Kymion supports rate-limiting, non-blocking handlers, and seamless task tracking.
